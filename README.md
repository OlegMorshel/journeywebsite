# Journey Web Site

It is the first web site with Adaptive layout

```
I want to practise in creating web sites using Adaptive layout.

I think that this web site somebody can use for their Travel Company.
```

###In this project I use:
**HTML 5*
**CSS 3*
**JS8*

I remember that using changing class in JS was a problem then.  But I some times later I do it with out problems.

For loadimg the project I should only open this [link](https://olegmorshel.github.io/journeywebsite/) and enjoy my creation.
